# Introduction

Very simple library for webcam native video capture that uses DirectShow to export basic C functions so they can be called from any language such as Java, Python, etc.

This was built to be used with JNA in https://github.com/eduramiba/webcam-capture-driver-native

Note: this library has been mostly coded with OpenAI Codex
